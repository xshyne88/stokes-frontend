          General notes:
          <Typography>
            - Maintenance of a given section includes maintaining the property
            line in addition to the grave spaces. Easements/borders in a given
            section need to be maintained alongside the grave spaces. For
            example, when maintaining sections K, J, H, &amp; G, the 10 or so
            feet from the last row to the green brick boundary wall of Mt.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Pleasant church also needs to be maintained. When maintaining the
            vacant land, this includes the area around the storage container and
            along the fence line of the church.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Maintenance of a given section also includes picking up the
            cemetery road and any access roads in that section.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - The front of the cemetery (along Bruton boulevard) needs to be
            picked up on an as needed basis. Passerbyâ€™s often throw trash here
          </Typography>
        </div>
      </ListItem>
      {lands.map(land => (
        <ListItem className={classes.listItem} key={land.id}>
          <AreaCard land={land} />
